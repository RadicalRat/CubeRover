CubeRover

Code to control and operate the CubeRover. Code is split into three different folders that align with the platform they are intended to be run on: GroundStation (computer), Pi, and Teensy. The rover is controlled either through a bluetooth controller connected to the computer running the GroundStation code or through the gui.

To Install:
Download the executable in GroundStation/dist. Opening the executable will automatically start the code.

To Run:
To run without the use of the executable, run the Main.py file in the Groundstation folder.
